# ToolGripEditor #

A Roblox plugin that makes the process of editing a Tool's Grip properties a
whole lot simpler.

To use, activate the plugin (![plugin icon](https://raw.github.com/Anaminus/roblox-tool-grip-editor/master/ToolGripEditor/wrench_hold.png 'plugin icon')), and select the Tool you want to edit (it must
have a Handle). A dummy character will appear above the tool, with handles
that you can drag. The orange arrows change the position of the tool, while
the green circular handles change the orientation. When close enough, the
orientation snaps to 90 degree angles.

Here's an example of what it looks like:
